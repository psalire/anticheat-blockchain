    - Main smart contract stores all player smart contracts
    - Server communicates with this smart contract to get info
  - 2 - Corda?
    - Each player is associated with a node
    - Game state is stored on blockchain
    - Custom consensus algorithm that checks game state
- Expose REST API on Server for blockchain
  - APIs for
    - Configuring new blockchains/game sessions
    - Starting game session
    - Defining Game Actions, which map to defining smart contract functions
    - Querying player status e.g. is banned or not?
    - Ending game session
